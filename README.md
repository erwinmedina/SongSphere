## About

This project is designed for people who enjoy music. We wanted people who enjoy using a service like Spotify and giving them something a bit more. The idea behind SongSphere is to offer a richer experience, offer more creativity with playlists, and interact with other users.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install packages:
```
npm i next.
```
Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
